## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting housing prices using statistical and exploratory data analysis techniques. The goal is to understand the key factors that influence house prices and evaluate how well these factors explain price variations through regression analysis.

The project is designed as a data analytics portfolio piece, emphasizing analytical thinking, interpretation of results, and clear presentation of insights rather than machine learning deployment.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key factors that influence housing prices  
- Explore relationships between property features and sale prices  
- Build and evaluate regression models for price prediction  
- Interpret statistical outputs for business and policy insights  

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains housing-related attributes, including:

- Property size (e.g., square footage)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location-related features
- Property condition and amenities
- Sale price (target variable)

> Note: The dataset was cleaned and prepared before analysis to handle missing values, non-numeric entries, and inconsistencies.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning & Regression Analysis)
- Descriptive Statistics
- Correlation Analysis
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- Power BI (for visualization, if applicable)

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed blanks and duplicates
   - Converted non-numeric values
   - Standardized variable formats

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visual exploration of key variables

3. **Regression Analysis**
   - Defined housing price as the dependent variable
   - Selected structural and locational features as predictors
   - Evaluated model performance using R², Adjusted R², and F-statistics

4. **Interpretation**
   - Assessed the impact of each predictor
   - Identified statistically significant variables
   - Explained findings in business-friendly terms

## 📈 Key Findings
- Housing prices are strongly influenced by structural features such as property size and number of rooms.
- Some variables show weak or insignificant relationships with price.
- The regression model explains a moderate portion of price variation, indicating that external factors may also play a role.

---

## 📌 Limitations
- The model is based on historical data and assumptions of linear regression.
- External factors such as economic conditions and market trends were not included.
- Results should be interpreted as analytical insights, not exact market predictions.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Include more location-based and economic variables
- Apply advanced predictive models
- Expand analysis with time-series or regional segmentation
- Enhance visualization with interactive dashboards
